# 🎨 Introduction to CSS

**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** is the language used to **style and design** HTML elements on a web page. While HTML provides the structure, CSS controls the **visual presentation**, including layout, colors, fonts, spacing, animations, and responsiveness.

### 🎯 Purpose of CSS:
- Separate **content** (HTML) from **design**
- Create visually engaging and responsive web pages
- Apply consistent styles across multiple pages

### 🔑 Key Features:
- 🎨 Control of color, fonts, spacing, and layout
- 📱 Responsive design using media queries
- 🧱 Box model for element sizing and spacing
- ⚙️ Support for animations, transitions, and effects
- 🧩 Can be written as inline, internal, or external styles

### 📘 Example:
```html
<style>
  body {
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  }

  h1 {
    color: #2c3e50;
    text-align: center;
  }
</style>
